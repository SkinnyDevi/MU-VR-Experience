## Backend

## Frontend
This project uses free SNAPS Prototyping Assets from Unity Asset store, as well as the [SNAPS Tool](https://assetstore.unity.com/packages/tools/integration/asset-swap-tool-151202?aid=1101lPGj&utm_campaign=unity_affiliate&utm_medium=affiliate&utm_source=partnerize-linkmaker), ProBuilder and ProGrids plugins. 

To avoid uploading unused Prefabs, only the Materials folder is uploaded to provide the changed materials for the Prefabs, which can be obtained in the Unity Asset Store:
