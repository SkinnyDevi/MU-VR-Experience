## User Gameplay
Once inside the application, you are greeted with a first person view with a character which you can interact using the default controls with keyboard and mouse. To see Virtual Reality controls, [click here](#virtual-reality-movement).

You move the camera around using your mouse, by moving it left, right, up and down.

You move the player around by using the WASD keys to accordingly move up, left, down and right.

You have a small crosshair in the middle of the screen which indicates where you will be clicking. To click, use the corresponding left click action within your mouse to interact with interactable objects.
